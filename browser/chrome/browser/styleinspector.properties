# this link displayed to the right of each property.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (rule.showUnmatchedLink): Each style property

# rules. If the user wants to see all of the unmatched rules, he/she must click
# the link displayed at the bottom of the rules table. That link shows how many
# rules are not displayed. This is the string used when the link is generated.
